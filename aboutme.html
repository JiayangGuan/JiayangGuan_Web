        <h2>About Jiayang Guan</h2>
        
        
        <p class="introduce">Jiayang Guan (Jay), Male, 20 years old, College student, second year in BMCC, majoring in studio art. Immigrant from China has lived in New York for 7 years, now taking place in Brooklyn. My hobby is drawing and playing games, I can sit in my place and draw or play games all day. I am shy, don't speak unless necessary. And I am interested in e-sports and motorsports, also like listening to pop and symphony music. My favorite colors are magenta and purple. My goal for now is to transfer to Hunter College and my dream career is to become a video game concept artist.</p>
