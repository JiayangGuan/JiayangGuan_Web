        <h3>My Raster selfie image</h3>

        <h3>My Vector selfie image</h3>
        <h4>As mentioned in my self-introduction, my affinity for purple and magenta led me to utilize these colors in Adobe Illustrator to create a vibrant vector self-portrait.</h4>

        <h3>10second Animation</h3>
        <h4>My first ever creation using Adobe After Effects is a captivating animation featuring a lost boy under a rain-filled cloud. Accompanied by a melancholic yet serene background track.</h4>

        <h3>Psjs sketch</h3>
        <h4>My self-designed pig cartoon image, brought to life through my first-ever used of the p5.js sketch. This creation possesses an interactive element, viewers can clicking on it and playfully exploring its response to mouse movements.</h4>

        <h3>Back to home Audio</h3>
        <h4>My debut audio composition crafted first ever using Audacity Description. This recording combines my own voice with resources shared by online users. It vividly depicts my daily routine upon returning home: approaching the door, retrieving the key to unlock it, removing my coat, opening the refrigerator to grab drink and food, and ultimately switching on the computer to indulge in Netflix content.</h4>

        <h3>Horn is not the way to vent your anger</h3>
        <h4>I created a fully animated and hand-drawn short film entirely on my own. The minimalistic style was adapted due to time constraints. This captivating story revolves around a driver who encounters persistent honking from the car behind him in various scenarios. Eventually, the driver fails to notice pedestrians on the sidewalk and ends up in a car accident. The film serves as a powerful reminder to practice patience while driving. It's important to note that the plot is entirely my original concept, any resemblance to real-life events is purely coincidental.</h4>
